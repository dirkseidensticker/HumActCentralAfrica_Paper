1,"Obobogo",-1200,400,"The oldest known pottery in central southern Cameroon is named after the site of Obobogo, south of Yaoundé (Claes 1985), and has been discovered at multiple sites in the area (Essomba 1989; Atangana 1988; Mbida Mindzié 1995). Rescue excavations at the site of Dibambe, south of Douala, have yielded a very similar pottery inventory, classified as ‘tradition E’ (de Saulieu et al. 2017, 36). The 14C-dates associated with this kind of pottery span the entire 1st millennium BC, with three dates even falling into the second half of the 2nd millennium BC.","A"
2,"Malongo/Bissiang",-1000,0,"The oldest pottery in the coastala area of southern Cameroon has been described by Gouem Gouem (2010, 330–341) reefing to inventories from the site of Bissiang. Nlend Nlend (2013, 233–249) based his analysis on the inventory from Malongo in order to describe the very same set of ceramics. The 14C-dates associated with this kind of pottery cover the entire 1st milliennium BC.","A"
3,"Bwambé/Mpoengu",-700,0,"More or less contemporenous and still to be found within the coast areas of southern Cameroon the Mpoengu/ Bwambé group has been described by Gouem Gouem (2010, 352–358) and Nlend Nlend (2013, 255) respectively. While the vessels shapes and ornament is different from the Bissang/Malongo group, the 14C-Dates indicate that the Mpoengu/Bwambé group is only slightly younger, dating from the 7th to 1st c. BC, while the bulk of dates are contemporagnous with those being associated to Bissang/Malongo ceramics.","A"
4,"Dibamba E",-800,-400,"At the site of Dibamba a pottery with striking similarities to the pottery from the Yaoundé area, summed up within the Obobogo group, as well as to the Malongo/Bissiang group from the coastal areas further south, has been identified as oldest phase (de Saulieu et al. 2017, 36). Two 14C-dates cover the 8th to 5th c. AD.","A"
5,"Dibamba D",0,400,"The second phase encountered at the site of Dibamba dates into the 1st to 4th c. AD and shows some resemblance to the pottery uncovered at Campo (de Saulieu et al. 2017, 34–36). Even more resemblance can be observed compared to the pottery found south at the mouth of the Sanaga river, at Mouanko Lobethal (Eggert 2002).","A"
6,"Campo",0,400,"The Campo group was first described by Nlend Nlend (Nlend Nlend 2013) and additional data, as well as a detailed description of formal and ornamental attributes of the ceramics, have been published within the final report of the excavations conducted at the eponymous site (Eggert and Seidensticker 2016).","A"
7,"Akonetye North",0,400,"The formal aspects and decoration first found at the southern site of Akonétye (Meister and Eggert 2008, 186–193) show similarities to the Bissiang/Malongo group, while the available 14C-dates for are cover the first half of the 1st millennium AD.","A"
8,"Akonetye South",0,400,"A roughly contemporaneous to the inventory found at the southern site but stylistically very different pottery has been found at the northern site of Akonétye (Meister and Eggert 2008, 193–196). Additonal material of this pottery group has been found during further east at Minyin (Meister and Eggert 2008, 196–197) and Akom (de Saulieu, Ngouoh, and Oslisly 2015, 413 Fig. 6). Six 14C-dates from these sites indicate the 1st to 4th c. AD as the phase of this pottery. ","A"
9,"Bidjouka",50,600,"According to (Gouem Gouem 2010) a second phase of the Early Iron Age in southern Cameroon is represented by the Bidjouka potter, described at the sites Bidjouka, Bidou, Kribi-Talla and Kribi-Mpoengu. The available chronological data indicate a date between the 1st and 7th c. AD (Gouem Gouem 2010/2011: 371 Fig. 33.6). The Bidjouka pottery is largely contemporaneous to the Campo groups, but shows different vessels shapes and decorational patters.","A"
10,"Dibamba C",1000,1300,"Substantially younger and marking the third phase at Dibamba, pottery associated with the Type C was dated into the 11th to 13th c. AD (de Saulieu et al. 2017, 32).","A"
11,"Dibamba B",1300,1700,"A very diverse set of well decorated ceramics found prominently at the site of Dibamba and described as Type C has been dated to the 14th to 17th c. AD (de Saulieu et al. 2017, 31–32). Similar pottery was found further south, close to the mouth of the Sanaga river at Mounako Lobethal (Eggert 2002; de Saulieu et al. 2017, 32).","A"
12,"Dibamba A",1600,1950,"The most recent pottery phase encountered at the site of Dibamba is summed-up within the Type A. This set of ceramics that are widely associated with European import finds are dated into the 17th to early 20th c. AD (de Saulieu et al. 2017, 28–31).","A"
13,"Okala/Epona/Yindo",-500,0,"The start of the local sequence in Gabon is marked by the pottery group described by Clist (2004, 489–533) as Okala group, after a site close to Libreville. He integrates the earlier described pottery group Epona, which was found within the middle Ogooué valley (Oslisly 1992; Oslisly 1994; Oslisly 1998; Oslisly 2001), into the Okala group, as well as the Yindo pottery group of the Lopé reserve (Assoko Ndong 2000; Assoko Ndong 2002). Okala pottery shows distinct similarities to the early pottery groups found within the coastal area of Cameroon. The available set of 14C-dates cover the 8th to 1st c. BC.","B"
14,"Okanda",-200,600,"After the Okala group, which is attested for within the entire north of Gabon and has strong links to groups from southern Cameroon as well, the pottery found within Gabon shows a distinct regionalization, with three more or less contemporaneous groups. The Okanda group is distributed within the middle Ogooué valley and can be dated into the 5th c. BC to 5th c. AD based on 14 14C-dates (Clist 2004, 619–622).","B"
15,"Otoumbi",-100,550,"Otoumbi pottery is also only attested for within the middle Ogooué valley, but slightly further north than the contemporaneuous Okanda group. The available 11 14C-dates indicate the 4th c. BC to 6th c. AD as the timeperiod of the Otoumbi pottery (Clist 2004, 623–625).","B"
16,"Oveng",0,800,"Oveng pottery has been found within the area of Libreville (Clist 2004, 615–618) as well as the small island of Corisco (González-Ruibal, Gelabert, and Mañe 2011; Sánchez-Elipe 2015; Sánchez-Elipe et al. 2016). The available 21 14C-dates associated with Oveng pottery are conclusively spaning the 1st to 6th c. AD, with only one date being slightly older and two dates slighly younger. A differentiation of the Oveng pottery into an early, middle and younger phase has been proposed for the inventories from Corisco island (Sánchez-Elipe 2015; Sánchez-Elipe et al. 2016).","B"
17,"Nandá/Group II",900,1200,"Substantial evidence of the former ‘Group II’, as defined by Clist (Clist 2004, 628–631), have been discovered on the island of Corisco and the pottery group has been renamed Nandá (Sánchez-Elipe 2015; Sánchez-Elipe et al. 2016, 357). Nandá pottery has – up to now – only to been found within the area of Libreville and on Corisco island. Ten 14C-dates indicate the 7th to 12th c. AD, with most dates being younger than AD 1000.","B"
18,"Angondjé",1000,1500,"The successor of the Nandá pottery in the area of Libreville and Corscio island is Angondjé group, which is associated with the first European contact finds and dates into the 10th to 16th c. AD (Clist 2004, 691; Sánchez-Elipe 2015, 224; Sánchez-Elipe et al. 2016, 357–358).","B"
19,"Lope",1200,1600,"Further inland, in the Lopé reservation, between the 11th to 19th c. AD a distinct pottery group named after the reservation itself has been described (Assoko Ndong 2000, 473–474). ","B"
20,"Ceramic Later Stone Age 1",-800,-500,"The oldest remains related to pottery production along the Atlantic coast of the Republic of the Congo are dated into the 13th c. BC, based on two radiocarbon dates (J. R. Denbow 2014, 62). Among the two older dates is one from Tchissanda-West (Tx-5956), which might be seens with caution with respect of the association with the find materials (J. Denbow 1990, 147). The remaining three 14C-dates associated with pottery that are grouped into the first phase of the Ceramic Later Stone Age as defined by Denbow (2012, 393–396; 2014, 62–64, 84–105) cover the 8th to 5th c. BC only.","C"
21,"Ceramic Later Stone Age 2",-500,-150,"A second phase of the Ceramic Later Stone Age along the Atlantic coast of the Republic of the Congo can be dated into the 4th to 2nd/1st c. BC on the basis of nine 14C-dates, with only one sample (Tx-6187) being slightly older. Regarding the pottery associatd with the second phase distinct similarities towards the earliest pottery further north, the Okala group (Clist 2004, 489–533) are discussed (J. R. Denbow 2014, 62).","C"
22,"Ngovo",-420,130,"The oldest pottery finds from south of the Congo river, within the ‘Kongo-Central’ province of the DRC, dating into the 15th c. BC are reported from the site of Sakuzi (de Maret 1982b; de Maret 2013, 634). The earlist reasonably certain pottery though is named after the site of Ngovo and dates into the 4th to 1st c. BC (de Maret 1986). Five radiocarbon dates support the age of the Ngovo pottery, while one date is slightly younger.","C"
23,"Herringbone",-250,530,"The early Iron Age within the coastal area of the Rep. Congo is associated with a distinct pottery that is particularly different from its predecesors. The so-called Herringbone ware (J. R. Denbow 2014, 64) is named after its most prominent decoration and dates into the 3rd/2nd c. BC to 5th/6th c. AD.","C"
24,"Kay Ladio",30,475,"The Ngovo pottery is followed by the Kay-Ladio group, which dates into the 1st to 4th c. AD and is the first pottery associated with iron metallurgy in the Lower Congo of the DRC (de Maret 1986, 119 Fig. 10.10, 125). The chronological positon of the Kay Ladio pottery is supported by five radiocarbon dates, three of which were results of recent excavations (Clist, Hubau, et al. 2019). ","C"
25,"Spaced Curvilinear",600,900,"Following the Carinated Broadly Grooved ware the Spaced Curvilinear ware (SC) is equally even more linked to pottery from the Katanga region of the DRC (J. R. Denbow 2014, 66). The available two reliable 14C-dates cover the 7th ot 9th c. AD.","C"
26,"Gombe",250,525,"The onset of pottery related features further inland, in the Pool Malebo area, is marked by the finds made at the site of Gombe Point. One 14C-date from the Île des Mimosas (Eggert 1984, 279-280 Fig. 8-9) and three TL dates on sherds from the eponymous sites (Cahen 1981, 131) cover a coherent phase, that ranges from the 3st to 5th c. AD.","C"
27,"Kitala",250,525,"Dating within the 3rd to 4th c. AD, the Kitala pottery groups has been uncovered within the Lower Congo region of the DRC only within recent excavations (Clist, Kaumba, et al. 2019). The Kitala pottery is closely related to the Kay Ladio groups and shows similarities to contemporaneous ceramics found within the Kinshasa area.","C"
28,"Carinated Broadly Grooved",300,500,"Following the Herringbone pottery, which can be associated with the first remains of iron production and use in the coast area of the Rep. Congo, the Carinanted Broadly Grooved ware (CBG) has been viewed as a distinct stylisitic ‘intrusion’ in the area, more linked to finds from northern Angola that the preceding pottery of the region (J. R. Denbow 2014, 64–66). Ony two 14C-dates are associated with this kind of pottery, both date into the 3rd to 6th c. AD.","C"
29,"Woven I",1100,1500,"The pottery of the Late Iron Age in the to coastal area of the Rep. Congo is charachterized by ‘moven’ motives and has been subdivided into two phases (J. Denbow 2012, 402–404; J. R. Denbow 2014, 136–145). Based on two 14C-dates and the absence of European contact finds in association with this type of pottery, the first phase of the Woven ware has to be dated between the 11th to 15th c. AD (J. R. Denbow 2014, 136). The stylegroups Dimba and Misenga as well as the so-called D-pots (Kongo D) depict similar types of decorations (Cranshof, Nikis, and de Maret 2018).","C"
30,"Mindouli",1800,1900,"The Mindouli pottery of the Niari basin is dated into the 19th c. AD and found to a lesser degree in association with remains of copper metallurgy (Nikis 2018, 190–199). The only radiocarbon date associated with pottery of the Mindouli type is supporting the later span of the putative period of this pottery, while the beginning can only be deduced from occasiaonal finds in which Mindouli pottery was found in association with the older styles Moubiri or Misenga. ","C"
31,"Boko-Songho",1800,1950,"The younger phase of the pottery found within the Niari basin was summed up withim the Boko-Songho type, which’s dating into the 19th to early 20th c. AD is not backed up by any absolute dates thus far (Nikis 2018, 204).","C"
32,"Kindoki",1250,1450,"The site of Kindoki offered a pottery assemblage informative of the beginning of the Late Iron Age in the region south of the Congo River. Based on two 14C-dates the Kindoki pottery can be dated into the late 13th to early 15th c. AD (Clist, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 245–253).","C"
33,"Misenga/Mbafu/Group II",1300,1500,"The former ‘Group II’ has been renamed by Clist (2012) as Mbafu facies and later subdivided into two styles by Cranshof et al. (2018, 177–184). One of these style was named Misenga, while the second is called Dimba. Pottery of the Misenga style was found at Kinshasa and directly eastwards along the border between the two Congos and has been dated into the 13th to 14th c. AD based on five newely obtained 14C-dates. One out of four conventional 14C-dates obtained in the 1980s (Hv-6260) is covering the time-frame set by the more recent AMS dates.","C"
34,"Kindangakanzi",1400,1600,"The pottery of the Kindangakanzi groups is – up to now – only found within the Niari basin and dated into the late 15th to early 17th c. AD based on one radiocarbon date (Nikis 2018, 183–184, 186 Fig. 5.25).","C"
35,"Mbafu/Group II",1300,1700,"Leftover from Cranshof et al. 2018","C"
36,"Moubiri",1400,1600,"Pottery of the Moubiri type has only been described within a very small area within the Niari basin and is dated into the late 15th to 18th c. AD (Nikis 2018, 179–183, 186 Fig. 5.25).","C"
37,"Dimba/Mbafu/Group II",1450,1850,"The Dimba style, which was described by Cranshof et al. (2018, 178–182) as a subcategory of the former ‘Group II’ and Mbanfu facies (Clist 2012), is equally distibuted in Kinsahasa and further east. The seven available 14C-dates support an age between the late 15th to early 19th c. AD.","C"
38,"Kongo A/Group IV",1450,1800,"The pottery associated with the time of the Kongo kingdom was subdiveded into four groups (A-D). The vessels summed up within the type A are similar to those described by Mortelmans (G. Mortelmans 1962a; G. Mortelmans 1962b) as Group IV (Clist, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 258 Fig. 19.16). Newly obtained 14C-dates cover the 15th to 18th c. AD (Clist, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 257-258 Tab. 19.3).","C"
39,"Kongo C/Group III",1500,1800,"The Type C pottery of the time-frame of the Kongo kingdom is equvalent to former Group III (G. Mortelmans 1962a; G. Mortelmans 1962b; Clist, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 266). It can be dated into the 16th to 18th c. AD.","C"
40,"Woven II",1500,1800,"The second phase of the Woven ware, again named after the most prominent decorational element on the vessels,  has only been recorded within surface-collections (J. R. Denbow 2014, 69–70). Due to association with european inport finds that date into the 16th to 18th c. AD, a substantially younger time range for the second group is proposed compared to the first Woven ware style (Cranshof, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 166 Fig. 7.1, 189).","C"
41,"Kongo B/Group V",1550,1800,"The second Type of pottery related to the time-span of the Kongo kingdom matches the former Groupce V after Mortelmans (1962a; 1962b; Clist, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 260–261). The chronological position can be restricted to the late 16th to 18th c. AD. ","C"
42,"Kongo D",1550,1750,"The so-called D-Pots show a very distinct and elaborate decoration. While it was only found in some excavations and the material is quite framented the available 14C-dates associated with these forms are covering the late 16th to early 18th c. AD (Clist, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 267–274; Cranshof, Nikis, and de Maret 2018, 184-187 Fig. 6.7).","C"
43,"Group X",1700,1900,"A later addition to the old and outdated sequence of pottery groups in the Lower Congo of the DRC, the so-called Group X was introduced by de Maret (1982a), while the respective pottery was first described by Cahen (1981, 135). A 14C-date from Gombe (GrN-7218) covers the 18th to 19th c. AD. Gosselain (1988, 22) associates another date from Kingabwa (Hv-626) with this groups, while de Maret (1982a, 83) associated this particular date with the former Group II by Mortelmans (1962a; 1962b).","C"
44,"Batalimo-Maluba",-200,600,"The oldest known ceramic inventories from the northern parts of the Congo Basin are derived from the inventories uncovered during excavations at Batalimo on the Lobaye river (de Bayle des Hermens 1975; Aumassip 1975) and Maluba on the Lua river (Eggert 1987). Based on four radiocarbon dates from Maluba and one thermoluminescence date, undisputedly associated with Batalimo-Maluba style pottery, the age span of the Batalimo-Maluba pottery can be restricted only to the 2nd c. BC to 6th c. AD (Seidensticker in press, 76–78). Later excavations at Batalimo yielded four additional radiocarbon dates supporting this age (Koté 1992). Unfortunately, no clear connection between these dates and the ceramics found in an association can be derived from the literature.","D"
45,"Ngbanja",-200,500,"The pottery of the Ngbanja group is closely related to the Batalimo-Maluba style but absolute and direct dating evidence is largely missing. The relationship between vessels associated with the Batalimo-Maluba groups and those summed up within the Ngbanja group have been reported earlier (Eggert 1987). Only a pit feature at Pikunda on the Sangha river, dated into the 4th c. BC to 4th c. AD and yielding mostly pottery of the Pikunda-Munda style, contained three sherds that could be associated with the Ngbanja group. Thus and until better assemblages and associated dates are uncovered it seems to be reasonable to consider the Ngbanja pottery as contemporaneous to the Batalimo-Maluba style and propose the 2nd c. BC to 4th c. AD as the time of the Ngbanja pottery (Seidensticker in press, 78–83).","D"
46,"Dongo",900,1600,"More loose similarities to either the Batalimo-Maluba and Ngbanja pottery as well as to the Motenge-Boma group are the only chronological circumstantial evidence for the chronological position of the pottery summed up within the Dongo style. While certain ornamental practices link this pottery to the older styles Batalimo-Maluba and Ngbanja, the shape of the rims and isolated occurrences of knotted strip roulette points towards a connection with the Motenge-Boma style. Due to the lack of absolute dating evidence the chronological position of the Dongo pottery can only be estimated. With regard to its position between the older and younger styles the 9th to 16th c. AD is proposed as the time span of the Dongo pottery (Seidensticker in press, 83–86).","D"
47,"Mokelo",900,1600,"While the use of zig-zag and arches on vessels of the Mokelo styles is similar to the Ngbnaja group, the occasional use of carved roulettes indicates a younger age. As direct evidence is missing one can only propose the 9th to 16th c. AD as the age range for the Mokelo style (Seidensticker in press, 86–89).","D"
48,"Bobulu",1200,1700,"The poorly decorated pottery summed up within the Bobulu style shows only partially diagnostic attributes that allow for including it into the relative chronology proposed for the Ubangi region. While it shows references to the styles Ngbanja and Mokelo, the shaping of the rims relates to the Konda group, which is to be found along the Ngoko and upper Sangha river. Based on the lack of absolute chronometric evidence linked to Bobulu pottery, the 12th to 17th c. AD is proposed as its provisional age (Seidensticker in press, 89–92).","D"
49,"Bokwango",1300,1800,"The pottery of the Bokwango style is only to be found along the lower Ubangi river and is not associated with any direct evidence for dating. The Bokwango pottery displays some characteristics from styles groups within the Inner Congo Basin, most notably the groups Mbandaka, Nkile, Lokondola, and Botendo (Seidensticker in press, 92–95). While the similarities towards the Lokondola style are the only ones point towards a chronological position within the Early Iron Age, the bulk of circumstantial evidence suggests that the Bokwango pottery is dating into the Late Iron Age and is related to the Equator-Co Tradition (Wotzka 1995). Thus we propose the 2nd m. AD as the provisional age of the Bokwango style.","D"
50,"Motenge-Boma",1500,1800,"Pottery of the Motenge-Boma styles was first reported on the basis of smaller excavations on the eponymous site (van Noten 1977; de Maret 1982b). Unfortunately, neither these first finds nor those uncovered during surveys that the River Reconnaissance Project made along the middle Ubangi river, yielded any association with datable material. Thus the provided age range for the Motenge-Boma style can only be provisional. While a vessel from the inventory of the RMCA (Coart and de Haulleville 1907, Pl. 14.204), which dates into the time of the ‘Congo Freestate’, showed a similar decoration, modern-day potters productions show significant differences, indicating some chronological distance between these ceramics and the Motenge-Boma group (Seidensticker in press, 95–99). Thus we propose the 15th to 18th c. AD as the provisionary age-range of the Motenge-Boma style.","D"
51,"Bangui",1900,1985,"A modern-day potters product along the upper Ubangi river, which is characterized by its lack of roulette decoration, is the so-called Bangui group (Seidensticker in press, 108–111). ","D"
52,"Dama",1900,1985,"The production of pottery summed up within the Dama style was recorded in 1985 at the eponymous site as well as two other villages on the upper Ubangi river. Thus the 20th c. AD can be accepted as the time of the Dama style (Seidensticker in press, 102–105).","D"
53,"Kpetene",1900,1985,"The surveys along the upper Ubangi river yielded some particular vessels and fragments that have been summed up within the Kptene group. It is comprised only of a few vessel units and no direct evidence for dating, except the fact that modern-day use was documented within the eponymous site, are known thus far. Based on the circumstantial evidence at hand it seems adequate to date the Kpetene style provisionally within the 19th to 20th c. AD (Seidensticker in press, 99–102).","D"
54,"Mbati-Ngombe",1900,1985,"The work of potters producing vessels of the Mbati-Ngombe style has been recorded at the eponymous village at the middle Ubangi river in 1985. Consequently, we assume that the 20th c. AD is the time frame of the Mbati-Ngombe group (Seidensticker in press, 105–108).","D"
55,"Pikunda-Munda",-200,500,"The oldest ceramics widely distributed within the western Congo Basin  are described within the Pikunda-Munda style, after excavations conducted in Pikunda along the middle Sangha river and Munda on the upper Likwala-aux-Herbes river (Eggert 1992; Eggert 1993). Nine conventional radiocarbon dates are associated with pottery of the Pikunda-Munda style. Considering the stratigraphy uncovered within a pit at Munda the onset of the Pikunda-Munda style should be considered within the 2nd to 1st c. BC, while the youngest available dates suggest that the style progressed until the 5th c. AD (Seidensticker in press, 111–117). ","E"
56,"Bokonongo",-200,500,"The Bokonongo group is a poorly attested for set of ceramic vessels found along the lower Sangha river valley that shares similraities with the the Pikunda-Munda group. As there are no 14C-dates associated with pottery of that style, the 2nd c. BC to 5th c. AD is provisionally presumed as the timeframe of the Bokonogo group. Additonally to similarities with the Pikunda-Munda pottery of the lower Sangha river valley, sherds associated with the Bokonogo style show some characteristics also found, and exclusively found within the Oveng group of coastal Gabon (Seidensticker in press, 117–120). ","E"
57,"Bobusa",250,700,"The Bobusa groups is comprised of inventories from the lower Sangha river area that shows particular stylistic, but most importantly technological characteristics. Pottery of the Bobusa groups contains grog temper on a regular basis and shapes and decorations show similarities to pottery found at the Île des Mimosa in Kinshasa, which have been dated into the 2nd to 4th c. AD. In lack of direct chronometric evidence the dating from the Kinshasa area is presumed to represent the timeframe of the Bobusa style as well (Seidensticker in press, 159–162).","E"
58,"Matoto",1000,1400,"The Matoto style is comprised of a heterogenous set of inventories showing similar pottery fabrics and rim shapes. While pottery grouped within that style was found in low numbers throughout the entire north-western Congo Basin, and no 14C-date is uniquely associated with it, the chronological position of the Matoto style needs to be based on relative chronological reasoning. Two dates on bone material from features at Maluba on the Lua river dating into the 11th to 14th c. AD constitute a terminus ante quem for the Matoto style. Unless direct dating is avalible this timeframe is seen as the provisional period of the Matoto style (Seidensticker in press, 125–128).","E"
59,"Ngombe",1100,1300,"Attest for within a small pit feature at the eponymous site of Ngombe as well as various surveys on the Sangha river, the Ngombe style shows striking similarities to the stylegroups Longa and Mbandaka of the Inner Congo Basin (Wotzka 1995, 121–128, 139–143). With no 14C-dates available the time-span of the Ngombe style can only be deduced from its similiraties to the Longa and Mbandaka styles. Thus the 12th to 14th c. AD is assumed to be the timeframe of the Ngombe style until absolute dating is available (Seidensticker in press, 120–125).","E"
60,"Ebambe",1500,1987,"Pottery of the Ebambe style is omnipresent along the Likwala-aux-Herbes river and to a slightly lesser degree on the Sangha river further west. As the 14C-dates associated with the Ebambe style are inconclusive, two of them are dating into the 7th to 14th c. AD, the beginning of the Ebambe style can not the conclusively been dated. As pottery of that style was observed of being still in use within the area, the provisional time span proposed for the Ebambe style is the 16th to 20th c. AD (Seidensticker in press, 128–133).","E"
61,"Epena",1900,1987,"The Epena style constitutes the modern-day pottery production along the Likwala-aux-Herbes river. It was discovered to produced in the late 20th c. AD at the eponymous village on the upper Likwala-aux-Herbes river and is distributed along the entire course of that river as well as at some sites further to the west and south. The only reliable chronological indications place the Epena style within the 20th c. AD, while its onset can not be dated properly thus far (Seidensticker in press, 134–138).","E"
62,"Mobaka",1850,1987,"Another pottery style present within the modern-day assamblages along the lower Sangha and Likwala-aux-Herbes river is called Mobaka. While there are no chronometric data available spreading light on the beginning of the Mobaka style, pottery of that group is included in ethnographic collections dating back into early colonial times. As it has been reported of being in use within the late 20th c. AD, the provisional time span of the Mobaka style – up to current knowledge – is the late 19th to 20th c. AD (Seidensticker in press, 138–141).","E"
63,"Mandombe",1300,1500,"The onset of the Ngoko tradition is marked by the Mandombe style, which has been excavated extensively at Pikunda along the Sangha river. Thus far only a single 14C-date from a pit features at Pikunda that dates into the 13th to 15th c. AD informs about the time span of the Mandombe style. Pottery of that style can be found along the upper Sangha river as well as on the Ngoko river (Seidensticker in press, 142–145).","E"
64,"Konda",1350,1550,"All remaining pottery styles of the Ngoko tradition are without absolute chronometric data and can – thus far – only be dated based on relative chronological considerations. The Mandombe style, dated into the 13th to 15th c. AD is followed by the Konda group. This style shows shares characteristics with the Mandombe style as well as the Pandama style, which on itself leads over towards the modern day pottery summed up within the Mbenja group. Thus the 14th to 16th c. AD is considered as the time of the Konda style until better and direct chronometric data are available (Seidensticker in press, 145–149).","E"
65,"Ouesso",1500,1700,"The Ouesso style shows similarities towards the stylegroups Ebambe, Konda and Pandama. Based on these comparative data and in lack of absolute chronometric data the 16th to 17th c. AD is proposed as provision time spand of the Ouesso style (Seidensticker in press, 149–152).","E"
66,"Pandama",1600,1900,"The Pandama style is found along the Ngoko and upper Sangha river exclusevly and shares characteristics with the modern-day Mbenja pottery as well as the Konda group. Without any direct dating available indicating the age of the Pandama pottery, the time span of this style can only be deduced based on the stylistic similarities. Thus far the 17th to 19th c. AD is presumend to be the time frame of the Pandama style (Seidensticker in press, 152–155).","E"
67,"Mbenja",1900,1987,"The modern day pottery observed within fieldwork in the late 1980s along the Ngoko as well as upper Sangha river is summed up within the Mbeja stylegroup. While the onset of this style can not he dated yet, only the 20th c. AD can be proposed as the timeframe of the Mbenja style thus far (Seidensticker in press, 155–159).","E"
68,"Imbonga",-400,-100,"The oldest pottery style within the Inner Congo Basin is the Imbonga group. Out of the 12 radiocarbon dates that were associated with pottery of that style, only 6 have been accepted by Wotzka (Wotzka 1995, 67 Tab. 9) [67 Tab. 9]. Two dates (Hv-11574, Hv-12627) are too old, while four dates (Hv-11571, Hv-11573, GrN-13586, KN-4205) are considered being too young. In general Wotzka (1995, 67) considers the 4th to 2nd c. BC as the probable date of the Imbonga group. On the lower Sangha river, Imbonga pottery was found at two sites, Mobaka (KI-2894) and Mitula (KI-2895). Each site yielded a radiocarbon date, that besides their large standard error are in accordance with the dates from the Inner Congo Basin. Additionally, one newer date on a P. glaucum grain from Boso Njafo (Erl-17763) was associated with Imbonga pottery as well and dates into the 4th to 2nd c. BC as well (Kahlheber et al. 2014).","F"
69,"Bonkake",-250,-50,"By Eggert (1983) seen as part of the ‘Imbonga horizon’, the pottery of the Bonkake group was separated by Wotzka (1995). There are no radiocarbon dates associated with Bonkake pottery but is seen as partially identical with a well-advanced Imbonga. As long as newer fieldwork provides a better base for dating the Bonkake style we suggest it be dated into the mid 3rd to mid 1st c. BC provisionally.","F"
70,"Ingende",-250,-50,"Likewise, the Ingende style, that according to Wotzka (1995, 88) has to be viewed as approximately simultaneous, partially parallel to the Imbonga group, was initially lumped into the ‘Imbonga horizon’ by Eggert (1983). Wotzka (1995, 88) suggests that the Ingende pottery outlasts the end of the Imbonga group at around 100 BC. As with the Bonkake group, there are no radiocarbon dates available that provide independent evidence for the dating of the Ingende group and for the time being we can only place it contemporaneous into the mid 3rd to mid 1st c. BC. ","F"
71,"Inganda",-200,100,"The Inganda pottery, which was also seen as part of the ‘Imbonga horizon’ by Eggert (1983), has been described by Wotzka (1995, 84), based on stylistic considerations, as an essentially younger phenomenon than the Bonkake and Ingende styles. The Inganda groups can be dated into the 2nd c. BC to 1st c. AD based on three consistent radiocarbon dates from Bokuma (GrN-14003, KI-2432, KI-2433).","F"
72,"Lokondola",-100,400,"The Lokondola pottery, while stylistically closely linked to the Inganda style, shows similarities to the younger styles Bokuma and Lingonda and must be considered an essentially subsequently phenomenon to the Inganda group (Wotzka 1995, 89, 94). While no radiocarbon dates are available to date the Lokondola group, based on these stylistic links the Lokondola pottery is provisionally dated between the mid 1st c. BC and 4th c. AD by us.","F"
73,"Monkoto",-100,200,"The Monkoto pottery is representing a chronologically adjacent group, but mainly younger phenomenon to the styles Lokondola as well as Yete (Wotzka 1995, 99). While there are five radiocarbon dates available from features that yielded Monkoto pottery (ibid. 99 Tab. 32), only the youngest (Hv-12613) dating into the 1st c. BC to the 2nd c. AD is seen as accurate by Wotzka (ibid.).","F"
74,"Bokele",0,200,"The Bokele group is seen by Wotzka (1995, 103) as approximately contemporaneous to the Monkoto style. A radiocarbon date (KN-4202) from a features containing Bokele and Lingonda pottery from the eponymous site of Bokele (ibid. 312 Cat.-No. 9) dates into the 1st to 3rd c. AD, thus Wotzka (ibid. 104) tentatively accepts the first two centuries after the turn of time to be the period of the Bokele pottery.","F"
75,"Lusako",-50,250,"Lusako pottery is, based on stylistic reasoning, basically later than the Inganda style and contemporaneous with the styles Lokondola and Yete according to Wotzka (1995: 106–107). The only radiocarbon sample associated with pottery of the Lusako style is a feature along the Sangha river (Seidensticker in press). While the pit only yielded one rim fragment of the Lusako group its inventory, which consists mainly of pottery of the Pikunda-Munda group, is dated into the 2nd c. BC to mid 3rd c. AD (KI-2877). This date is consistent with the dating Wotzka presents for the Inganda groups and accepting Wotzkas view that the Lusako style shall be later than the Inganda group, the Lusako pottery might be placed best into the 1st to 3rd c. AD until more dates are available.","F"
76,"Yete",100,400,"The Yete pottery, which is stylistically related to the Lokondola group, shows similarities toward the younger pottery styles Bokuma and Lingonda, but unlike Lokondola pottery, the connections of Yete pottery towards the Inganda style are only poorly developed (Wotzka 1995: 94). Thus while the Yete pottery might be viewed as a more or less contemporaneous phenomenon towards the Lokondola group (ibid.), and without any direct dates available, we placed it within the 2nd to 4th c. AD for the time being.","F"
77,"Lingonda",200,700,"There are six radiocarbon dates associated with Lingonda pottery from the Inner Congo Basin known. Thus based on the stylistic relations and derived chronological evidence, Wotzka (1995: 115) only accepts three to be representative for the Lingonda style (GrN-13076, GrN-14004, KN-4206). In general Wotzka (ibid.) considers the second half of the 3rd to the 7th c. AD the period of the Lingonda group.","F"
78,"Bokuma",200,550,"The Bokuma pottery is considered to be contemporaneous to the Lingonda group (Wotzka 1995: 120) and based on a single radiocarbon date from the eponymous site of Bokuma (GrN-14004), which is associated with Lingonda pottery as well, the style can be dated into the 3rd to the mid of the 6th c. AD for the time being.","F"
79,"Longa",1000,1400,"The Longa pottery, while showing some similarities to the styles Bokuma and Bokele, can be easily connected to the younger part of the sequence of pottery styles that Wotzka (1995: 127) describes. Most importantly, the strong stylistic connections to the Bondongo group are pointing towards a rather younger age of the Longa style (ibid.). Three radiocarbon samples that yielded very different ages are associated with Longa pottery (ibid. 127 Tab. 53). Two dates from Wafanya were also associated with Monkoto pottery (Hv-12611, Hv-12613) and date into the 13th to 5th c. BC and 2nd c. CB to 4th c. AD respectively. The third date (Hv-11572) was associated with Lingonda and Longa pottery and dates into the 11th to 15th c. AD. Based on the association with these other styles and the great spread of those three dates, Wotzka (ibid.) was not able to present a conclusive age of the Longa pottery. Judging the strong stylistic links between the Longa pottery and the Bondongo style we suggest to accept the youngest of those three dates as representative for the Longa group until new data arrive.","F"
80,"Bondongo",1000,1400,"Besides the Imbonga style, the pottery of the Bondongo group is currently the most well-dated style within the Inner Congo Basin. Nine out of 14 radiocarbon dates that were associated with Bondongo pottery have been accepted by Wotzka (1995: 138 Tab. 58). Those nine dates cover a period from the 11th to the end of the 14th c. AD (Ki-2364). ","F"
81,"Mbandaka",1000,1400,"Based on the results of the excavations at the eponymous site at Mbandaka as well as the strong stylistic relations, Wotzka (1995: 143) has no doubts about the extensive or even complete chronological congruence of the styles Mbandaka and Bondongo. Only one out of four radiocarbon dates that are associated with pottery of the Mbandaka style was not rejected as too young by Wotzka (ibid.). The date in question covers the later half of the 12th up to the 14th c. AD. A very similar date from a feature at Bokele (Hv-11572) yielding mostly pottery of the styles Mbandaka and Longa, but also Lingonda and Bokele (ibid. 104, 115, 127), has been rejected by Wotzka (ibid. 143) as representative for the Mbandaka group without a detailed discussion. Based on those two dates that are associated with Mbandaka pottery, besides other styles, one might accept a provisional date of the style group ranging from the 11th to 14th c. AD.","F"
82,"Besongo",1300,1600,"The Besongo group is described by Wotzka (1995: 206) as a partially parallel but primarily younger phenomenon as the Bondongo group. Based on that assessment and with direct dating evidence missing we can only assume that the 13th to 16th c. AD is representing the time of the Besongo pottery.","F"
83,"Nkile",1300,1600,"The Nkile pottery is seen by Wotzka (1995: 149) as a connection between the Bondongo group and the younger Botendo pottery, but Wotzka (ibid.) questions a close chronological vicinity between the styles Bondongo and Nkile. A single radiocarbon date from the eponymous site (Hv-8916), which is associated with Bondongo as well as Nkile pottery, dates into the late 13th up to the end of the 14th c. AD. It is currently the only basis for a chronological assertion of the Nkile style. While the beginning of the Nkile pottery, based on the mentioned date, might be placed towards the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th c. AD, we tend to stretch the end of the Nkile style up to at least the end of the 16th c. AD in order to close the gap towards the Botendo style. Thus provisionally the Nkile group might be dated between the 13th to 16th c. AD.","F"
84,"Malelembe",1300,1600,"The Malelembe pottery is representing a local variant of the Nkile style (Wotzka 1995: 201). At the moment there is no independent evidence for the absolute dating of the Malelembe pottery known. Hence we can only assume the time span of the Nkile style, the 13th to 16th c. AD is representative of the Malelembe pottery as well.","F"
85,"Botendo",1700,1920,"The Botendo pottery is representing the contemporary ceramic during the so-called ‘Independent State of the Congo’ or ‘État indépendant du Congo/Kongo-Vrijstaat’ (Wotzka 1995: 157; see Anonymous 1907: 155-157 Pl. 12). Two radiocarbon dates are associated with Botendo pottery, bot from the same trench at Nkile (Wotzka 1995: 158 Tab. 70). While one date gave a modern age, the second date into the end of the 17th c. AD until modern times. The youngest evidence for Botendo pottery was found within the mentioned deserted village of Nkile, which was listed as an inhabited village in 1915 and in that Botendo pottery was constituting the youngest archaeological phase (ibid. 158). Thus while the results from Nkile present a terminus ante quem, the radiocarbon dates point towards the beginning of the Botendo style around the end of the 17th c. AD (ibid.).","F"
86,"Lokonge",1700,1900,"The Lokonge pottery is a regional facies of the Botendo style (Wotzka 1995: 200). Without direct dates associated with Lokonge style pottery, we can only assume that the chronological assertion for the Botendo group is also applicable for the Lokonge style. Thus we assume the 17th to 19th c. AD to be the period of the Lokonge groups for the time being.","F"
87,"Likuku",1700,1900,"The Likuku pottery, which is only distributed along the Lulonga and Lopori can stylistically only be associated with the Bokone group of the Tshuapa tradition (Wotzka 1995: 201). For the time being there is no independent mean of dating available for the Likuku pottery. Thus we can only assume that the Likuku pottery is dating into the 18th to 19th c. AD such as the Bokone group.","F"
88,"Ikenge",1900,1978,"The recent pottery production within the western parts of the Inner Congo Basin and the ending point of the “west tradition” of the “equator-co tradition” is characterized by the production from the Ikenge, which is described in details by Eggert & Kanimba Misago (1980; Wotzka 1995: 221-222). Until a starting date can be deduced based on stratified findings of this style, it can only be attributed with the 20th c. AD.","F"
89,"Bekongo",1000,1200,"Based on stylistic reasoning and without any radiocarbon dates associated with the Bekongo style, Wotzka (1995: 162) reasons for a chronological position within the overlapping period of the styles Longa and Bondongo, but without a complete congruence with neither the Longa group nor the Bondongo style (ibid.). With the challenging dating of the Longa pottery in mind and the fact that the Bekongo pottery gets succeeded by the Wafanya pottery, we propose a date between the 11th to 12th c. AD for the Bekongo pottery for the time being.","F"
90,"Wafanya",1100,1300,"The Wafanya group shows such strong stylistic relations to the Bondongo pottery that chronological proximity to the ‘classical’ Bondongo is most likely (Wotzka 1995: 167). The Wafanya pottery is not a specific ‘late variety’ of the Bondongo group, but a regional facies along the Luilaka river. As Wotzka (ibid.) is sure that the Wafanya style is directly preceding the Bekongo group, we assume the Wanfaya pottery to be dating in between 12th to 13th c. AD, until direct dates are available.","F"
91,"Wema",1200,1400,"The beginning of the Tshuapa tradition is marked by the Wema groups, which is late, with respect to shape and decoration rather simplified manifestation of the Bondongo style (Wotzka 1995: 171). Out of three radiocarbon dates that are associated with Wema pottery, only one is accepted by Wotzka (ibid. 172 Tab. 81) as being representative. It dates into the 13th to 14th c. AD, which should be considered the period of the Wema groups for the time being.","F"
92,"Bosanga",1300,1600,"The Bosanga pottery is representing a stylistic link between the Wema style and the Bolondo pottery (Wotzka 1995: 175). Based on stylistic as well as stratigraphic reasoning Wotzka (ibid.) stresses the simultaneity of the Bosanga pottery with the Nkile group. Thus we accept the 14th to 16th c. AD as the period of the Bosanga pottery as well.","F"
93,"Bolondo",1450,1800,"The younger Bolondo pottery shows stylistic reminiscences towards the Bondongo style (Wotzka 1995: 180). Bolondo pottery was associated with three radiocarbon dates. Based on stylistic and stratigraphic reasoning, Wotzka (ibid. 181) only accepted the youngest date, dating back to the end of the 14th c. AD until modern times (KN-4203). As the Bolondo pottery is followed by three styles (Bokono, Bolombi, and Ilemba-Bokonda), we assume that it ended somewhere around the 18th c. AD until more precise data become available.","F"
94,"Bokone",1700,1900,"The Bokone group is, based on stylistic and stratigraphic observations, described by Wotzka (1995: 185) as a link between the Bolondo pottery and the recent products of the potter's village at Ilemba-Bokonda. No radiocarbon dates are associated with Bokone pottery, hence, for the time being, we assume that the Bokone pottery dates somewhere between the 18th to 19th c. AD.","F"
95,"Bolombi",1800,1950,"Equally without any radiocarbon dates associated to it and assuming that it is not merely a specific facies of the recent potter's production along the Tshuapa as seen in Ilemba-Bokonda, the Bolombi group can only be seen as a link between the Bokone group and the recent products from Ilembe-Bokonda (Wotzka 1995: 187). Thus until better data are available our provisional age span of the Bolombi pottery is the 19th to early 20th c. AD.","F"
96,"Ilemba-Bokonda",1900,1983,"In 1983 the River Reconnaissance Project documented the potter's production within the village of Ilemba-Bokonda that is distributed nearly along the entire Tshuapa river. Without any direct dates illuminating the onset of the Ilemba-Bokonda style, we can only assign the 20th c. AD as time of the Ilemba-Bokonda group.","F"
97,"Inkaka",1800,1900,"While the Inkaka pottery could not be integrated within the relative chronological framework of the Inner Congo Basin, Wotzka (1995: 196) suggested a sub-recent age for it, based on stratigraphic evidence of vessel found at Ngombe-Malala. Thus and until better data are available we propose the 19th c. AD as the period of the Inkaka group.","F"
98,"Liyolongo",1950,1983,"The contemporaneous potter's production along the Busira was documented in 1983 at Liyolonga (Wotzka 1995: 196). This pottery is constituting the recent end of the pottery sequence in that part of the Inner Congo Basin. Thus we assume the Liyolonga to be dating into the 20th c. AD until data are available that can be used to deduce the beginning of the group.","F"
99,"Mpokioko",1600,1800,"The Mpokioko pottery was only found on the upper Maringa river and, based on sparse stylistic evidence, might be best positioned in between the styles Bolondo and Bokone that are part of the Tshuapa tradition (Wotzka 1995: 202). As direct dating evidence is missing, we assume that the Mpokioko pottery dates within the 16th to 18th c. AD.","F"
100,"Yopoko",1900,1983,"In 1983 the contemporaneous pottery production at the village Yopoko was observed by the River Reconnaissance Project. Equally to other recent potters products, no data are available concerning the onset of this style, thus we can only assign the 20th c. AD as the period of the Yopoko pottery as well.","F"
101,"Nkomba",1850,1900,"The Nkomba pottery is displayed, as the Botendo pottery, within the published inventory of the Royal Museum for Central Africa (Coart and de Haulleville 1907, 189-191 Pl. 13; Wotzka 1995, 210). Based on that Wotzka (ibid.) summarized that the Nkomba pottery belongs to the last two decades of the 19th c. AD at least. Within the framework of this study, the 19th AD is viewed as the time period of the Nkomba group.","F"
102,"Lisala",1900,1980,"Based on its mint condition (e.g. fresh breaks and well-preserved surfaces) Wotzka (1995: 207) assumed the pottery he subsumed within the Lisala group to be of recent age. Without any better means of dating we can only assume the 20th c. AD to be the period of the Lisala pottery.","F"
103,"Early Pottery Phase",-400,100,"Based on the limited fieldwork carried out thus far within the eastern parts of the Congo Basin, a sequence of pottery groups spanning the past 2500 years has been proposed (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017). The earliest pottery found within the region west of Kisangani is summed up within the Early Potter Phase, which can be dated into the 4th c. BC to 1st c. AD on the basis of five 14C-dates (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 111 Fig. 23). While certain similatiries of this pottery with the Imbonga style of the Inner Congo Basin are discussed (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 110), while its has similarities to the Ngbanja pottery (Seidensticker in press, 80–85, 204).","G"
104,"Middle Pottery Phase",50,450,"The material of the early phase is followed by a distinctly different set of shapes, summed up as Middle Pottery Phase (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 110-113 Fig. 25). The four available 14C-dates for this group cover the 1st to 5th c. AD. While the pottery of the Middle Phase is considerable different from the earlier ceramics in terms of shapes and decoration, the production techniques seem to be similar (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 110–112).","G"
105,"Ilambi",700,1600,"The later phase of pottery producing groups in the region west of Kisangani can be further sub-divided into three pottery styles : the two newly described styles Ilambi and Yaekela (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 111–114) and the Nkomba style that was already encountered within the northern parts of the Inner Congo Basin (Wotzka 1995, 207–210, 536 Pl. 102.2-4,6-16). The only style group that was discovered in association with 14C-dates is the Ilambi style. But the two available dates are very different: while one date covers the 8th to 10th c. AD the second one dates into the 15th to 17th c. AD (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 98 Tab. 1). The onset of the later pottery phase in the region is marked by a significant change in production technique (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 111). For the time being no discision on the correct time-span of the Ilambi pottery can be given.","G"
106,"Yaekela",1100,1850,"Another pottery style of the later phase found within the region west of the Kisangani it the Yaekela style. For the time being no 14C-dates are associated with Yeakela pottery (Livingstone Smith et al. 2017, 111, 117 Fig. 27). While for the Ilambi style roulette decoration could not be described with certainty, the Yaekela pottery shows regular decoration using carved roulette. Shaping techniques are similar to the Ilambi style and based on these similarities the 12th to early 19th c. AD is proposed as provisional time span of the Yaekela style.","G"
107,"Kamilambian",600,700,"The earliest pottery associated with the Iron Age in the northern parts of the Upemba depression is summed up wihtin the Kamilambian, which is dated from the 6th to 8th c. AD (de Maret 1982a, 87–88; de Maret 1992, 199–200). The pottery of the Kamilambian is related to the insuffienctly described early pottery of norther Angola (Clark 1968, 78:191–204) as well as the Early Iron Age Chondwe Ware of northern Zambia (Phillipson 1968, 196–197).","J"
108,"Early Kisalian",700,1000,"Between the 8th to 10th c. AD., Kamilambian pottery morphs into the early Kisalian ceramics . It is the first pottery that is associated with the destinct, rich burial practices found in latter periods within the Upemba depression (de Maret 1977; de Maret 1982a, 88–90; de Maret 1985, 120:256–257; de Maret 1992, 199–201, 259).

AD (de Maret 1982a, 89–91). These graves contain an abundace of copper objects and the pottery shows very distinct characteristics. The classical Kisalian phase is often linked to the emergence of a hierarchical society. Overall the Classical Kisalian dates between the 9th to 13th c. AD.","J"
110,"Kabambian A",1300,1600,"Changes in the Kisalian funary rites around the beginning of the 14th c. AD, most notably fewer grave goods and less elaborate pottery, together with the first appearances of croisettes mark the beginning of the Kabambian phase (de Maret 1982a, 92–93). The first phase of the Kabambia is dated between the 14th and 16th c. AD.","J"
111,"Kabambian B",1500,1800,"The second phase of the Kabambian, dating into the 16th to 18th c. AD, shows changes in the burial practicies and is marked by the appearance of very small croisettes as well as pottery clearly linked to the more recent Luba phase (de Maret 1982a, 93).","J"
112,"Luba",1700,1900,"Ethnohistorical records suggest the emergence of the Luba state towards the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th c. AD (de Maret 1982a, 93). This political entity expands during the 19th c. AD and becomes the Luba kingdom.","J"
113,"Carboneras",600,1200,"The island of Bioko poses a very unique chrono-cultural sequence as iron was introduced very late, maybe only within the 19th c. AD. The archaeological assamblages of prior phases are dominated by lithic industries combined with pottery. The initial phase connected to pottery producing groups on the island is the so-called Carboneras (González-Ruibal, Gelabert, and Mañe 2011, 43). The available radiocarbon dates suggest the 6th to 11th c. AD as the time of the Carboneras (Clist 1991, 161; Clist 1998). Only the later of the three phases of the Carboneras is associated with pits features, decorated pottery as well as grinding stones, polished axes and charred palm endocarps. Clist (1998) suggests similarities between the pottery of the Carboneras phase and the one summed up within the Nandá/Groupe II ceramic group of Gabon.","K"
114,"Buela",1150,1600,"The Carboneras is followed by two cultural phases, one being the so-called Buela. Thus far two radiocarbon dates are associated with material attributed to this group, while only one of these dates is solely associated with the Buela group (SR-105) (Clist 1998, 215 Tab. 1). This date offers an indication for the biginning of the Buela phase around the 13th c. AD, while the second, younger date (CSIC-97) suggests that the Buela groups existed well into the 16th c. AD.","K"
115,"Bolaopi",1200,1500,"The second phase succeding the Carbonears on Bioko island is the so-called Bolaopi group, which is only attest for through one radiocarbon date thus far (CSIC-97), which dates the pottery into the 13th to 15th c. AD (Clist 1998, 215 Tab. 1; 217).","K"
