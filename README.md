All data and scripts required to reproduce the analysis of the paper are located within this repository.

For users of the base R console, please define the work directory filepath where you stored the folder "CentralAfricaHumanActivity" by setting `setwd()`. If you use RStudio, you can open the `.Rproj` file instead.

## Folder and File Structure



* the `/input` folder contains all data and data produced by the `Figure 2 overall spd.R` script
* the `/output` folder contains all outputs generated by the scripts
* the `/script` folter contains all R-code produced in the context of this research
  * It is suggested to run `Figure 2 overall spd.R` before running other scripts as this script generated the `rcarbon` output stored within the `/input` folder. The results of this scripts are required in all scripts except `Figure 1 map.R`.
  * the `pkg.R` file serves as header file loading all necessary packages that are required to run the scripts. Please make sure, that you have installed and updated all requires packages.
  * the `fct.R` file contains custom build functions created in the course of this research.

All data are stored within the `/input` folder
